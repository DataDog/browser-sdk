'use strict'
// This wrapper script ensures that no other test is running in BrowserStack before launching the
// test command, to avoid overloading the service and making tests more flaky than necessary. This
// is also handled by the CI (exclusive lock on the "browserstack" resource), but it is helpful when
// launching tests outside of the CI.
//
// It used to re-run the test command based on its output (in particular, when the BrowserStack
// session failed to be created), but we observed that:
//
// * The retry logic of karma and wdio was more efficient to retry this kind of tests (the
// BrowserStack connection is re-created on each retry)
//
// * Aborting the test command via a SIGTERM signal was buggy and the command continued to run even
// after killing it. There might be a better way of prematurely aborting the test command if we need
// to in the future.
