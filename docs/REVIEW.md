# Code Review Guide (for agents)

What to look for when reviewing a PR. Linters, formatter and type-checker already run in CI — don't
repeat what they enforce. Focus on the project-specific concerns below.

## Principles

- **High signal only.** A wrong comment costs more than a missing one. If unsure, verify in the
  codebase or use `question:`, not `issue:`/`suggestion:`.
- **Check the existing pattern before flagging.** Code that looks wrong is often intentional and
  used elsewhere — grep first.
- **Don't restate code** or ask for comments that duplicate a clear name.
- **Few strong comments** beat many nitpicks.

## Comment style

Use [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) labels:

- `praise:` — genuinely good (not filler).
- `issue:` — a concrete bug/regression to fix.
- `suggestion:` — a concrete improvement you're confident about.
- `nitpick:` — trivial, non-blocking.
- `thought:` / `question:` — when unsure; prefer over a wrong `issue:`/`suggestion:`.

## What to look for

### Bundle size

The minifier mangles local/top-level names but **not property names or object keys**.

- Long property/method/key names that ship to the bundle (e.g. `private veryLongDescriptiveProperty`)
  — suggest shorter names. Local vars get minified, so ignore those.
- Patterns that minify poorly: `class` where a closure works, `enum` vs `const enum` (see "Size
  control" in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`).
- Dead abstractions: a one-call helper/wrapper/option adding bytes for no clear value.
- In general, any pattern that achieves the same result with less code is welcome.

### New bundles and entry points

Bundle sizes are tracked only for packages listed in `packages` in `scripts/lib/computeBundleSize.ts`.
When a PR adds a new package that produces a `bundle/` output (e.g. a new `browser-rum-*` CDN
bundle), flag it if the package is missing from that list. Otherwise its size won't be tracked.
New entry points or chunks inside an already listed package are picked up automatically.

### Backward compatibility

Backward compatibility is a requirement — watch for unintentional breaking changes: public API
changes, renamed/removed event fields, changed default values, or a different shape passed to
customer callbacks.

### Browser API availability

Browser APIs (e.g. `navigator.locks`, `navigator.sendBeacon`, `cookieStore`) may not exist in all
supported browsers or execution contexts (iframes, Web Workers). Any call to a browser API not
already established in the codebase must be guarded with an availability check.

See "Global object access" in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` for the recommended pattern.

### Documentation

Public APIs require a TSDoc comment, including:

- a clear description,
- at least one example,
- the `@hidden` tag if experimental,
- the `@internal` tag if internal.

### Conventions (read the source doc, don't rely on memory)

- Naming, dependency-as-parameter, file org, utils/specHelper scoping — `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Public API rules (no `enum`, options object for customer callbacks) — `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Telemetry usage scope and repo-wide rules — `AGENTS.md`.
- Test patterns (`registerCleanupTask`, `collectAsyncCalls`, `mockable`) — `AGENTS.md` /
  `docs/TESTING.md`.

### Reuse over reinvention

Prefer existing utilities/types over new ones (e.g. `globalObject` over raw `window`/`globalThis`,
existing `Context` types, `*Utils` helpers).

## Do NOT comment on

- What Prettier/ESLint/`tsc` enforce (formatting, `prefer-template`, `prefer-optional-chain`, unused
  vars, imports).
- Auto-generated files: `CHANGELOG.md`, schema-generated `*.types.ts` (`DO NOT MODIFY`) — flag only
  if edited by hand.
- Comments/JSDoc that restate a clear name.
- Speculative `null`/`undefined` guards without a concrete failing case.
