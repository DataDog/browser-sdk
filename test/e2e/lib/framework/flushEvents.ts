  // TODO: use /empty instead of /ok
  //
  // The RUM session replay recorder code uses a Web Worker to format the request data to be sent to
  // the intake.  Because all Worker communication is asynchronous, it cannot send its request
  // during the "beforeunload" event, but a few milliseconds after. Thus, when navigating, if the
  // future page loads very quickly, the page unload may occur before the recorder has time to send
  // its last segment.
  //
  // To avoid flaky e2e tests, we currently use /ok with a duration, to allow a bit more time to
  // send requests to intakes when the "beforeunload" event is dispatched.
  //
  // The issue mainly occurs with local e2e tests (not browserstack), because the network latency is
  // very low (same machine), so the request resolves very quickly. In real life conditions, this
  // issue is mitigated, because requests will likely take a few milliseconds to reach the server.
