# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. To propose
improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Submitting issues

Github issues are welcome, feel free to submit error reports and feature requests! Make sure to add
enough details to explain your use case. If you require further assistance, you can also contact
our [support][1].

## Pull Requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new feature and want to share it? Many thanks!

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve when submitting your
pull request:

- Keep commits small and focused, rebase your branch if needed.
- Write unit and e2e tests for the code you wrote.
- Write meaningful [Commit messages and Pull Request
  titles](#commit-messages-and-pull-request-titles)

Our CI is not (yet) public, so it may be difficult to understand why your pull request status is
failing. Make sure that all tests pass locally, and we'll try to sort it out in our CI.

## Commit messages and Pull Request titles

label our Commit messages and Pull Request titles:
